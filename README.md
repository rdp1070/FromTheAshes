#From The Ashes
A 4X game
##Premise
From the Ashes (FTA) is a 4X strategy game in the vain of the Civilization series and grand strategy games of Paradox Interactive. The game is set in a post-apocalyptic wasteland after some nondescript disaster. The player will start as a small tribe of humans struggling to survive the harsh environments, mutated animals, and other hostile tribes. It will focus on resource management, divergent forms of game play, and role playing aspects as every tribe, and its individual members, are different.
##Goals & Development
We will be using the Unreal Engine to make a 2D/3D hybrid game akin to similar games in the genre such as CIV.
